## Python file for solving Flow Based Models
## Function page -- call the defined function from another file

# Import list of OD pairs
# Run function on OD pairs according to Flow Model
# Return optimal locations

## Could have the optimization function an input parameter

## Could be the case we have multiple functions here that we are able to call
## FCLM, FRLM, SFCLM, . . .
